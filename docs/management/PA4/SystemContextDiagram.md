## 1. Technology Stack

The platform covers all core workflows spanning PA1 through PA4, including catalog search, book circulation, study room reservation, study groups, real-time notifications, and AI recommendation pipelines.

| Layer / Component | Technologies & Libraries | Purpose & Coverage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend UI** | Next.js 16 (App Router / RSC), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4 | Renders dynamic interfaces, executes client workflows, and delivers server-rendered pages for readers, librarians, and admins. |
| **Backend API Server** | Node.js, Express 5, Socket.IO 4.8, Passport.js, JWT, `node-cron` | Hosts RESTful endpoints, handles access control, runs scheduled jobs (e.g., PIN expiration), and pushes real-time events. |
| **Recommendation Engine** | Python 3, LightGBM, GraphSAGE, pandas, scikit-learn | Implements graph link prediction and candidate re-ranking for personalized book recommendations over TCP/JSON lines. |
| **Primary Database** | PostgreSQL 15, `pgvector`, `pg_trgm`, `intarray` | Stores relational catalog, circulation, room bookings, user accounts, and vector search embeddings. |
| **Knowledge Graph DB** | Memgraph MAGE (Bolt Protocol / Cypher) | Stores user-book interaction graphs to run real-time link-prediction algorithms. |
| **Authentication & Email** | Google OAuth 2.0, Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP) | Provides Single Sign-On (SSO) and handles transactional emails (OTPs, password recovery, group invites). |
| **Media & CDN** | Cloudinary API, External CDNs (Open Library) | Manages image uploads, profile avatars, and book cover asset delivery. |
| **AI / Machine Learning** | Hugging Face Transformers (`@huggingface/transformers`) | Supplies local NLP transformer models for generating catalog search embeddings. |

### 2.2 Diagram Mainflow Explanation

A **Visitor** accesses AmeThyst to browse public books, facilities, and study groups. A **Reader** additionally manages book and room reservations, recommendations, and study-group participation. **Librarians** handle catalog and circulation operations, while **System Administrators** manage accounts, roles, policy, and operational metrics.

The core system delegates identity checks to **Google Identity**, sends transactional emails via **Gmail SMTP**, hosts media on **Cloudinary**, and downloads transformer embedding model weights from the **Hugging Face Hub** during initialization when uncached locally.

### 2.3 Person Descriptions

| Person | Description | Key Interactivity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visitor | Unauthenticated visitor. | Browses the public book catalog, library map, facility information, and public study-group pages. |
| Reader (Library Patron) | Registered library user (persisted role: `user`). | Searches the catalog, reserves books and room slots, retrieves PINs, joins study groups, and receives personalized recommendations. |
| Librarian | Library staff member. | Verifies reader pickup/return PINs, inspects book conditions, manages physical copy inventory, and handles announcements. |
| System Administrator | Platform manager. | Manages user account roles, configures borrowing policies/limits, and monitors system analytics dashboards. |

### 2.4 External System Descriptions

| External System | Purpose | Communication Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Google Identity | Authenticates users securely via standard OAuth 2.0 protocols. | OAuth 2.0 over HTTPS |
| Gmail SMTP Service | Delivers transactional emails including OTPs, account verification links, and study group updates. | SMTP over TLS |
| Cloudinary CDN | Cloud media storage and delivery network for user profile avatars and custom book cover uploads. | HTTPS Media API / CDN |
| Hugging Face Hub | Repository supplying local vector embedding transformer model weights used for semantic catalog search. | HTTPS model weight download |
| External Image Hosts | External CDNs (e.g., `m.media-amazon.com`) serving remote book covers and user-supplied avatar URLs. | HTTPS |

## 3. AI Usage Notes

This document was drafted with the assistance of an AI tool, declared as follows:

- **Tool name**: Gemini (Google)
- **Access time**: August 3, 2026
- **Prompt**: “Assure the consistency of C4 system context diagram with Vision Document, and deeper level C4 diagram. Provide the description and explanation of the diagram components.”
- **Purpose**: Synthesize and format the C4 Level 1 System Context diagram and entity descriptions to integrate the main architectural document.
- **Content generated by AI**: C4 Level 1 System Context Mermaid diagram, person descriptions, external system table, and main flow prose.
- **Student's work and validation**: The student audited actor/persona consistency across Level 1 and Level 2, verified external dependencies (Google Identity, Gmail SMTP, Cloudinary, Hugging Face Hub, and External Image Hosts), and verified diagram alignment against the codebase and database schema.
