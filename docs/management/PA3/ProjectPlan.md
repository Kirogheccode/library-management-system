## 1. Introduction

Our project is a Modern Library Management System designed for everyone, combining the convenience of online services with the reliability of traditional, in-person library operations. The system enables users to search for and reserve physical books online, then quickly pick them up or return them in person. Beyond book management, the platform also manages physical spaces by offering a study room booking feature that supports both individual and group study sessions. In addition, an integrated AI recommendation tool suggests books tailored to each user's reading history, delivering a more personalized library experience.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to build a system that maximizes the management of all library resources — encompassing both books and rooms — while delivering a convenient, modern, and highly accessible experience to every user.

- **Provide an easy-to-use interface for users:** Simplify how users interact with the system, from searching for books to reserving study rooms, without requiring technical expertise.
- **Speed up physical checkouts:** Eliminate manual paperwork and long queues when borrowing books or booking study rooms.
- **Enable early availability checking**: Allow users to check book and study room availability in advance, reducing wasted trips and unnecessary waiting.
- **Optimize library assets:** Help staff manage book stock, monitor study room bookings, and review usage and financial data in real time.
- **Modernize the user experience:** Use AI to make finding books more intuitive and personalized to individual reading habits.

### 2.2 Scope of Work

#### 2.2.1 Target Users

- **Users seeking reference materials:** Students who need to quickly locate, reserve, and borrow physical books or textbooks for coursework and research.
- **Users seeking collaboration:** Users who want to connect with peers, form study groups, find study partners, and book collaborative spaces.
- **Users seeking quiet, focused spaces:** Users who need a quiet, structured environment for self-study, assignments, or individual projects.

#### 2.2.2 Target Environments

- **Web application:** Responsive interface compatible with major desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
- **Cross-platform access:** Accessible from any major operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) without requiring local installation.

### 2.3 Project Deliverables

The final product will be a fully operational web platform with integrated frontend, backend, and database components, covering the following functional modules:

1. **User Authentication & Authorization** — Supports single sign-on (SSO) via Google Account as well as standard self-registration.
2. **Profile Management** — A customizable dashboard for users to view, edit, and manage personal information, and to track their in-system transaction history.
3. **Advance Searching Feature** — Advanced filtering and search capabilities to efficiently locate library resources.
4. **Borrow & Reserving Feature** — Reservation of physical study spaces, combined with secure PIN-based authentication for in-person book borrowing and returns, synchronized automatically with the central database.
5. **Study Groups** — Enables users to create or join study groups and coordinate collaborative study sessions with peers.
6. **AI Recommendations** — Analyzes user reading history to generate personalized book recommendations.
7. **Librarian Administration** — Operational tools for library staff to update records, oversee circulation, and manage room reservations.
8. **Admin Administration** — Visual analytics and statistics on system metrics such as trending books and usage reports.
9. **User Assistance** — Provides comprehensive support features, including an interactive onboarding tour for new users, a responsive library floor map for locating specific zones and resources, and accessible documentation detailing system guides and library policies.

**Documentation deliverables:**
- A public GitHub repository containing the full source code.
- Complete documentation for all five Project Assignments (PAs).
- Spec Kit artifacts for all implemented functional groups, including UI/UX wireframes, architecture diagrams, database schemas, and system workflows.

### 2.4 Assumptions & Constraints

**Assumptions**

- All five team members will remain available and actively contribute throughout the project.
- The team will incorporate feedback from the Teaching Assistant promptly and thoroughly in each revision cycle.
- Project progress will be tracked through consistently maintained documentation.
- Third-party services will remain accessible and stable throughout development.


**Constraints**

- **Time:** The project is strictly limited to 5 Sprints (2–3 weeks each), corresponding to the 5 Project Assignments (PAs) scheduled throughout the semester.
- **Language:** All documentation, reports, and in-code comments must be written exclusively in English.
- **Process:** The team must follow the Scrum framework, using Jira for task tracking and GitHub for version control.
- **Personnel:** Despite having specialized role titles, every team member is expected to contribute as a full-stack engineer across report writing, development, and self-training.
- **Formatting:** All documentation must be written in Markdown (`.md`) with Mermaid diagrams, and a converted PDF version must accompany every submission.
- **AI Declaration:** A detailed AI Usage Declaration must be provided for every section that uses AI assistance; submissions missing this declaration will not be graded.
- **Quality Assurance:** The system must be verified as functional at every stage of development to ensure a reliable final product.
- **Workload Distribution:** Tasks must be distributed fairly and efficiently throughout the development process.

## 3. Project Organization

### 3.1 Team Structure and Roles

The team consists of five members, each holding a primary specialization while also contributing as a full-stack engineer across the project.

|Member|Role|Main Responsibilities|
|---|---|---|
|Vũ Duy Nhất|Project Manager & Full-stack Engineer (Team Leader)|Manages project timelines, assigns tasks, coordinates team communication, and owns the overall system architecture. Contributes to both front-end and back-end development for core features.|
|Nguyễn Nhựt Huy|UI/UX Designer & Front-end Engineer|Designs wireframes and prototypes, optimizes user experience, and translates design mockups into clean, production-ready front-end code.|
|Trần Lê Hoàng Gia|Technical Lead & Back-end Engineer|Designs database schemas, builds and optimizes APIs, handles server-side logic, and ensures system security and scalability.|
|Nguyễn Lê Hoàng Khải|Full-stack Engineer & DevOps Specialist|Develops both front-end and back-end features as needed, configures environments, sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages repositories, and deploys the application.|
|Phan Lê Anh Minh|Full-stack Engineer & Quality Assurance (Tester)|Contributes to feature development, and leads the QA process by writing test cases, executing testing, and tracking bugs.|

Decision-making follows a consensus-first approach; if consensus cannot be reached, the team defaults to a majority vote, with the Project Manager holding final authority on non-technical deadlocks and the Technical Lead on purely technical disputes.

### 3.2 Risk Management

||Risk|Likelihood|Impact|Mitigation Strategy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|**Member unavailability** — a team member becomes unreachable or unable to complete assigned tasks due to personal issues, illness, or academic workload.|Medium|High|Members must notify the team at least 24 hours before a deadline if they anticipate missing it. Available members redistribute the affected workload, and the delayed member compensates in a subsequent sprint.|
|2|**Technology / integration issues** — difficulties integrating the AI recommendation engine, third-party services (e.g. Google OAuth), or the front-end/back-end stack (Next.js, Node.js/Express).|Medium|Medium|Allocate dedicated research and prototyping time early in the sprint before full implementation. The Technical Lead reviews architecture decisions in advance, and the team maintains a fallback (simpler) implementation option for high-risk features such as AI recommendations.|
|3|**Scope creep** — the project scope expands beyond what is feasible within the 5-sprint timeline (e.g. adding non-essential features).|Medium|High|All feature changes must go through the team's consensus/majority-vote decision process before implementation. The Project Manager cross-checks new requests against the Jira backlog and sprint capacity before approval.|
|4|**Uneven task distribution / workload imbalance** — some members contribute significantly more or less than others, causing delays or team friction.|Low|Medium|Track task completion and code contributions through Jira story points and GitHub Pull Requests. Apply the team's escalation procedure (friendly reminder → official warning → instructor escalation).|
|5|**Data loss or version conflicts** — unsynchronized work or accidental overwrites in the shared GitHub repository.|Low|High|Enforce the branching strategy (`main` / `dev` / `feature/*` / `doc/*`), require `git fetch` and `git pull` before starting work, and mandate at least one peer review before merging any Pull Request.|
