- **Summary of the meeting:** Firstly, the team reviewed the past week's progress, evaluating the current web architecture and code organization. To prepare for the next sprint, we then identified fixes for edge cases, discussed the GUI design for the Filter use case, and aligned on role definitions (Librarian/Admin) according to design on Figma, which requires adding new fields to the users table. Additionally, the team leader talked about change of repository structure (database folder, Makefile, package files), SpecKit agent workflows and discussed switching to alternative agent models to save token. Finally, the team leader assigned tasks to team members and provided them implementation ideas if needed.
